                <h2> Why did I choose to create this website?</h2>
                <p> I made a website from scratch for my Capstone project because code is one of the most important languages to learn in this century.
                    I am notoriously bad with technology, and challenging myself to learn the basics of this gruelling discipline helped me better refine my proficiency with a computer. Seriously, 
                    spending half an hour at a time looking for the smallest syntax error in a big wall of code is no easy feat! I've lost count of the times I contemplated tearing my hair out because I couldn't find where I 
                    made the mistake of not indenting an HTML element properly.

            <h2> Great, coding is cool. But why a study tips website specifically?</h2>
            <p> I love this question. Throughout my highschool career, if it wasn't moans of dispair that erupted 
                from my classmates after a test, it would be lament about not having studied effectively/sufficiently enough for it. 
                But how do you measure how effectively one studies for a test? There's no standard metric to quantify the efficiency of how Person A studies
                versus a Person B; some people barely study, yet get top grades in all subjects. After observing that there's no perfect study method that
                s a one-fits-all cookie cutter, I thought: can I help people <em> learn how to learn?</em> 
                <br>
                To clarify, I'm no perfect student.
                <br>
                I make my fair share of mistakes and sometimes blank out during tests despite having studied all I thought there was to study.

            <h2> How does this project relate to my future career plans?</h2>
            <p> There's no specific career I'm dead set on pursuing. However, 
                 I believe that being equipped with coding skills can unlock more possibilities and help me become more versatile, as technology is continually evolving. Having the ability to adjust to various industries' demands would 
                 benefit me greatly in my professional future. I might study cognitive science -- an interdisciplinary field involving the study of
                psychology, computer science, philosophy, neuroscience and linguistics --- at university, so having a foundational skillset 
            could aid in my studies greatly.</p>
